Pathos is a hybrid journaling system that seeks to use both the physical and digital aspects of journaling to enhance the others experience.

Initially built as a modular mental health companion, we hope to expand Pathos into a truly modular system to help even the most challenged individuals design systems that work for them, instead of systems they have to work for.
